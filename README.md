# CareBot!

This is a simple Discord bot that can help you with your daily self-care journey! 

## Introduction
**Why CareBot?**
We came up with this idea from one of our university's orientation training sessions: taking care of oneself while caring for other mentees. Although there are a lot of resources available online when it comes to self-care methods, sometimes it is difficult to come up with what we need at the moment and we are unsure of what to do. We hope that CareBot will reduce the need to tediously search for resources and remind the users of the possible ways they can take care of themselves, with 4 response options which are simple to use.

**How did we build this bot?**
We used [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [discord.js v13](https://discord.js.org/#/) and [Heroku CLI](https://www.heroku.com/about) to build and successfully run the bot 24/7.

## How to CareBot? Get started

First, if you haven't already, make a discord account. (it's free!) Follow the steps after you click on [this link](https://discord.com/register).

Once you've made an account, [create your private server](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/204849977-How-do-I-create-a-server-) (or ANY server that you have permission to invite the bot works too) and click on [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=877238344722038824&scope=bot&permissions=8589934591) to invite the bot. You're all set and you are now ready to use the bot!

## -help command

The classic `-help` command will guide you through all the commands the bot can offer you. Although there are only two commands, we are planning to expand the command scope and add more content to the bot in the near future.

## -init command

This is where all the fun begins! The commands are very straightforward, and you will have no trouble navigating through all the tips :)

When you initialize the bot with `-init`, it will create a private channel only for you and the bot (and potentially the moderators who have permission to see the channel). Once the bot sends you a message in that private channel, you will have 4 options available for you to respond: "**yes**", "**no**", "**ok**" and "**stop**". Simply type your response in the chat and the bot will take care of the rest!

We have spent the majority of our time gathering the information and coming up with the bot's responses, but we realize it is far from complete. If you have any other suggestions, please feel free to [let us know](mailto:andric0901@gmail.com)!

## Next steps for CareBot!
We are planning to add more content to the existing self-care methods, such as personal hygiene and hobbies. Moreover, there are tons of possibilities for more commands, as the code is very flexible to all the changes; we are currently brainstorming possible new commands.

**Thank you so much for using CareBot!** We hope you have a wonderful day :)
